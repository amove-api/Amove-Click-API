# Amove Click (AmoveAgent) API Documentation

## Introduction

The AmoveAgent API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for managing cloud storage, user authentication, project management, and various other functionalities. This API is designed to facilitate seamless integration with cloud storage services, user management, and project collaboration.

## Authentication

Most endpoints in this API require authentication. Authentication is typically done using a token, which should be included in the query parameters of the request. For example:

```
GET /endpoint?token=your_token_here
```

Some endpoints may require different authentication methods, such as JWT tokens or session-based authentication. Please refer to the specific endpoint documentation for detailed authentication requirements.

## Main Endpoint Categories

1. Authentication
2. Cloud Management
3. Projects
4. User Management
5. Storage
6. Transfer
7. Billing

## Getting Started

To get started with the AmoveAgent API:

1. Sign up for an account (if required)
2. Obtain your API token
3. Make your first API call using your preferred programming language or tool

Here's a basic example of how to make an API call using Python and the `requests` library:

```python
import requests

API_BASE_URL = "https://api.amoveagent.com"
TOKEN = "your_token_here"

response = requests.get(f"{API_BASE_URL}/User/get_all_users", params={"token": TOKEN})

if response.status_code == 200:
    users = response.json()
    print(users)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
    print(response.text)
```
